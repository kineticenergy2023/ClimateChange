# Climate Change Analysis Project - Group 6

## Project Overview

This is an academic group project (Group 6) focused on **Climate Change data analysis and prediction**. The project combines data science, statistical analysis, and machine learning to explore relationships between climate variables and economic indicators.

## Project Structure

- **Main Analysis**: `Group 6 - code.ipynb` - A comprehensive Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis (9.7MB)
- **Presentation**: `Group 6 - Presentation Slides.pdf` - Project presentation slides (2.2MB)
- **Documentation**: Basic README and MIT license

## Key Components

### 1. Data Analysis Focus
- **Climate Change Variables**: The project extensively analyzes various climate-related metrics including:
  - CO2 emissions (multiple measurements: per capita, per GDP, from different fuel sources)
  - Greenhouse gas emissions (methane, nitrous oxide, total emissions)
  - Environmental indicators (forest area, protected areas, renewable energy output)
  - Agricultural and environmental factors

### 2. Economic Analysis
- **Income Group Classification**: Countries are categorized by income levels to analyze relationships between economic development and environmental impact
- **Emissions by Income Group**: Analysis of how emissions patterns vary across different economic development levels
- **Consumption patterns**: Energy and resource consumption analysis by income groups

### 3. Statistical Methods
- **Correlation Analysis**: Heat maps showing relationships between climate change variables
- **Data Visualization**: Multiple charts and graphs including bar plots for emissions and consumption by income group
- **Missing Data Analysis**: Systematic handling of incomplete datasets

### 4. Machine Learning Implementation
- **Random Forest Models**: Primary machine learning approach for prediction
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identification of the most significant variables affecting climate outcomes
- **Model Optimization**: Grid search and parameter tuning for improved performance
- **Grouped Response Modeling**: Classification approaches for income group prediction

## Research Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Uses what appears to be World Bank or similar international development datasets
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalization, missing value handling, and feature engineering
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Correlation analysis and visualization of climate patterns
4. **Predictive Modeling**: Machine learning models to predict climate/economic relationships
5. **Results Interpretation**: Feature importance analysis and model performance evaluation

## Key Insights Areas

- Relationship between economic development (income groups) and environmental impact
- Factors most strongly associated with climate change indicators
- Predictive capabilities for climate outcomes based on socioeconomic variables
- Cross-country comparative analysis of emissions and environmental policies

## Technical Details

- **Language**: Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Primary ML Algorithm**: Random Forest with hyperparameter optimization
- **Data Visualization**: Seaborn/Matplotlib for correlation heatmaps and statistical plots
- **Statistical Analysis**: Pandas for data manipulation and analysis

This appears to be a substantial data science project examining the intersection of climate change, economic development, and environmental policy across different countries and income groups.
